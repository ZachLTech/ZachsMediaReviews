# READ-ONLY ARCHIVED REPO
All further examples including this one have been moved to the official [webdevdocs](https://github.com/ZachLTech/webdevcourse) repository where each example lives in an [examples branch](https://github.com/ZachLTech/webdevcourse/tree/examples) instead for organization/consolidation. You can navigate all the examples [here](https://zachltech.github.io/webdevcourse/) and see the source code [here](https://github.com/ZachLTech/webdevcourse/tree/examples)

The Zach's Media Reviews demo link below still works and the page hasn't changed. Only it's location in github did.


## ZachsMediaReviews
Example Code for HTML section of https://webdev.zachl.space

If you're coming from that site check out the code above and see the demo linked below for the results!
All images and such are stored in the `assets` folder and the homepage is indicated by the `index.html`.
Normally I would put the other pages in a separate `pages` folder but github's website deplyment system was being a little weird.
